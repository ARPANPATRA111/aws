## The AWS Global Infrastructure Relationship

It's important to understand the relationship between the core components of AWS's global footprint:

* **AWS Regions** are physical locations around the world where AWS clusters data centers.
* **Availability Zones (AZs)** are the multiple, isolated data centers contained within each AWS Region.
* **Edge Locations** are part of a separate, worldwide network outside of the AWS Regions. They are specifically designed to cache content and deliver data with lower latency.
