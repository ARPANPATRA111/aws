# Module 2 â€” Compute in the Cloud ðŸ’»

Status: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

## What is Amazon EC2?

**Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)** is the AWS service that provides secure, resizable compute capacityâ€”essentially, virtual serversâ€”in the cloud. Instead of buying and managing your own physical servers, you can launch **EC2 instances** in minutes and scale your capacity up or down as needed.

EC2 instances are **virtual machines (VMs)**. They run on a physical host machine that is shared with other instances, a concept known as **multi-tenancy**. The isolation and resource management between these VMs is handled by a **hypervisor**, which is managed entirely by AWS. You, the customer, have complete control over the instance itself, including:

* **Operating System (OS):** Choose between various distributions of Linux or Windows.
* **Software:** Install your own business applications, web servers, databases, or third-party software.
* **Sizing:** You can resize an instance by giving it more CPU or memory, a process called **vertical scaling**.
* **Networking:** You control who can access your instance.

You only pay for the time your instances are running, making it a highly flexible and cost-effective way to acquire compute power.
