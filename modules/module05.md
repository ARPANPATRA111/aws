# Module 5 â€” Networking ðŸ”—

Status: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

## What is Networking in AWS?

At its core, networking is a system of **interconnected devices that can exchange data and share resources**. In the AWS Cloud, this is primarily managed through the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud.

### Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

An **Amazon VPC** is a service that lets you provision a **logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define**. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including your own private IP address range.

Within a VPC, you organize your resources into **subnets**. A subnet is a range of IP addresses that you use to group resources. The primary distinction is between private and public:

* **Public Subnets:** Contain resources, like a web server, that need to be accessible from the internet.
* **Private Subnets:** Contain resources, like a backend database, that should be isolated from users on the internet.

### Availability Zones (AZs)

An **Availability Zone** is a physically isolated data center or set of data centers within an AWS Region. Its primary function is to **enhance application availability and fault tolerance** by allowing you to deploy resources across multiple, redundant locations within the same Region.

## Connecting to Your VPC

### Gateways for VPC Access

* **Internet Gateway:** This is the "front door" to your VPC, allowing communication between resources in your public subnets and the internet.
* **Virtual Private Gateway:** This is a private "door" used to establish a secure, private connection between your on--premises network and your VPC. It is the VPN endpoint on the AWS side of the connection.

### Dedicated and VPN Connectivity

* **AWS Direct Connect:** This service establishes a **dedicated private connection** from your on-premises network to an Amazon VPC. It's the best choice when you need a consistent network experience with **increased bandwidth**.
* **AWS Site-to-Site VPN:** This is a cost-effective solution that creates a **secure, encrypted connection** between your on-premises sites (like data centers or branch offices) and your Amazon VPC over the public internet.
* **AWS Client VPN:** A fully managed service for connecting your **remote workforce** to your AWS and on-premises resources. It provides advanced authentication and automatically scales based on user demand.

## Securing Your VPC Network

### Shared Responsibility for Networking

Based on the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, the customer is responsible for **securing network traffic within their VPC**. This is primarily done using Network ACLs and Security Groups.

### Network Access Control Lists (Network ACLs)

* **Role & Scope:** Acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more **subnets**. It's your first line of defense.
* **Rules:** You can set up both **allow and deny** rules for broad traffic control.
* **State:** Network ACLs are **stateless**. They check every packet that crosses the subnet boundary (inbound and outbound) without remembering previous traffic.

### Security Groups

* **Role & Scope:** Acts as a virtual firewall for your **EC2 instances** to control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.
* **Rules:** You can only set up **allow** rules. By default, all inbound traffic is denied.
* **State:** Security Groups are **stateful**. If you allow incoming traffic, the corresponding outgoing (return) traffic is automatically allowed, regardless of outbound rules.
